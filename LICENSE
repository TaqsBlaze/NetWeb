## Description of the Project:

This project is a Web Application Firewall (WAF) Node.js package designed for modern security needs. It focuses on the following features:

- **Rate Limiting**: Control traffic to prevent abuse.
- **Rule-Based Request Blocking**: Dynamically block requests based on custom rules.
- **Logging and Alerting**: Provide detailed logging and alerting for suspicious activities.

By using this package, developers can protect their web applications and services efficiently with customizable security rules and robust request handling mechanisms.
